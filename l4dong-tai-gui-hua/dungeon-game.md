# Dungeon Game

The demons had captured the princess \(**P**\) and imprisoned her in the bottom-right corner of a dungeon. The dungeon consists of M x N rooms laid out in a 2D grid. Our valiant knight \(**K**\) was initially positioned in the top-left room and must fight his way through the dungeon to rescue the princess.

The knight has an initial health point represented by a positive integer. If at any point his health point drops to 0 or below, he dies immediately.

Some of the rooms are guarded by demons, so the knight loses health \(_negative\_integers\) upon entering these rooms; other rooms are either empty \(\_0's_\) or contain magic orbs that increase the knight's health \(\_positive\_integers\).

In order to reach the princess as quickly as possible, the knight decides to move only rightward or downward in each step.

**Write a function to determine the knight's minimum initial health so that he is able to rescue the princess.**

For example, given the dungeon below, the initial health of the knight must be at least**7**if he follows the optimal path`RIGHT-> RIGHT -> DOWN -> DOWN`.

| -2 \(K\) | -3 | 3 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| -5 | -10 | 1 |
| 10 | 30 | -5 \(P\) |

**Note:**

* The knight's health has no upper bound.
* Any room can contain threats or power-ups, even the first room the knight enters and the bottom-right room where the princess is imprisoned.

分析

从右下开始减当前格子，负数设为1，正数继续。 这样的话负格子才会累加，正格子设为1，不做考虑。
